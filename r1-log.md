The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on July 3, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
I finish the first leg of Python in my Bertelsmann Challenge on Udacity. The basics of lists, sets, and dictionaries. Dictionaries defintiely remind me of JSON. So they're at least visually familiar. 

### R1D2
Just started on conditionals and for loops today. I got a little frustrated one of the quizes when it had me hard coding a string  instead of trying to use format at the end with a variable. Go figure, the next lesson they wanted me to solve it with the format function.
Looping over lists is similar to C#. That makes it a lot easier.
