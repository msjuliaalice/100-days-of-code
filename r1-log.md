# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Julia Layne

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on July 3, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
I finish the first leg of Python in my Bertelsmann Challenge on Udacity. The basics of lists, sets, and dictionaries. Dictionaries defintiely remind me of JSON. So they're at least visually familiar. 

### R1D2
Just started on conditionals and for loops today. I got a little frustrated one of the quizes when it had me hard coding a string  instead of trying to use format at the end with a variable. Go figure, the next lesson they wanted me to solve it with the format function.
Looping over lists is similar to C#. That makes it a lot easier.

## R1D3
While loops, Zips and Comprehensions. I'm still side eyeing. All the different ways to iterate. I spent enough time playing with my hair that I had to go grab some scissors and take a stab at my split ends. I made it through to the end of the module, though. Comprehensions remind me of spread functions. The lesson said that python was the only language with it. Maybe that is in the creation of a new list?
